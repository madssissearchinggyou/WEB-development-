A Simple Calculator.

The present paper is about a simple calculator that has been designed using HTML and CSS. This calculator comes with an intuitive user interface that provides buttons for numbers and basic arithmetic operations. To make it, we used HTML to define the structure of the layout and employed CSS to give it a more attractive look, which in turn boosted its efficiency. As such, this project demonstrates my practical knowledge on developing cleanly-designed, user-friendly web applications as well as my familiarity with front-end web development tools.
