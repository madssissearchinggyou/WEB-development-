Simple Calculator with Form Validation
This minor project involved developing a basic calculator using HTML and CSS, along with a form validation feature to ensure the integrity of user input. The project includes a form with fields designed to capture user details and verify that the information provided is relevant and accurate. By integrating form validation techniques, the calculator not only performs basic arithmetic operations but also checks that each form field is correctly filled out, enhancing both functionality and user experience. This project demonstrates my ability to combine fundamental web technologies with practical validation processes, showcasing my skills in both front-end development and user input verification.
